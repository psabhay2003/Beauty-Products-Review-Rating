Playful and Pricey: Check Ingredients,"This is my first experience using a gel-to-oil cream so I didn't know what to expect, though I hoped it'd leave my skin radiant and glowing (due to the words ""GLOW DAY CREAM"" in the name). *Note: There's no glow whatsoever.<br /><br />When I dip into a little bit of product, it's a shiny lightweight, non-sticky pink gel. As soon as I apply it to my face or to the top of my hand, it melts, spreads with ease, and leaves my skin velvety soft. The absorption rate is fairly quick compared to similar creams and oils, though usually if something is immediately devoured by my skin, there's no evidence it was there; this, however, leaves my skin smooth and without a greasy residue. It can easily be applied prior to makeup if needed. Finally, this gel has a nice medium fragrance that isn't overpowering or lingering.<br /><br />While I do like the heavy glass jar and think it looks nice, it's quite deceiving. With only one ounce of product inside, I have another jar of face cream that's the same size but contains twice the product. And when compared to other options, ingredients are crucial. (I've included a photo from the box.) While I recognize some as being good organic extracts and oils, the majority sound like chemical compounds I've never heard of.<br /><br />Being a mere breath away from 50, I need to factor in sun damage, a depletion of hormones, thinning skin, melanin spots, and overall aging when I decide what's best for my skincare. This product, while moisturizing, simply doesn't make the cut as something I'll order again.<br /><br />CONS STACKED UP:<br />- Only 1 oz of product<br />- Unfamiliar ingredients<br />- Lacking ingredients I look for based on skincare needs<br />- High price-point<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Leaves skin velvety soft<br />- Nice scent<br />- Absorbs well, no icky residue",B0B1M7JRHY,B0B1M7JRHY,1.66E+12,0,FALSE,

Very good quality; useful extras,"I'm very pleased with these glass bottles. The glass is thick and, while it's certainly not immune to breaking, it can deal with the occasional bump without a problem. Having it be tinted brown is great for limiting the amount of UV that can enter, plus gives it a nice look.  The caps are excellent and provide a good seal. The sprayers are just OK. They work, but are not all that heavy-duty. I'm using these more for storage than application, so I'm more interested in the cap seal than the sprayer.<br /><br />It also comes with a very useful funnel, a dropper and a white marker. The funnel is something that I'll use often; I won't use the others. But, it's a nice complement of accessories.<br /><br />The bottles come very well packaged with two layers of bubble pack, and are in a box that's the right size to prevent things from moving around.

Full & beautiful!!,"This is a good quality full-looking scrunchie, I twist my long hair together, clip it to the top of my head, pull it up through the center & attach the scrunchie to the top of my head with small tortoise-shell clips (red-brown in hair color) on each side which can easily be concealed in the hair. It is comfortable & stays in place through a 12hr shift. Since I wear this on top of my head, it conceals my thinning hair in front & on top of my head. I blend it over my bangs in front. These are great for work & in hot weather to keep longer hair securely & comfortably off of your neck. I have also used larger plastic hairpins to also help comfortably secure these. I need larger scrunchies like this due to hair loss & a big head. It is not made to fit tightly over a ponytail.<br />I actually bought this color knowing it would not match my hair, which is a burgundy/brown shade, not too bright. I have been experimenting in coloring synthetic hair with Speedball acrylic ink & 70% alcohol in a spray bottle (see you-tube videos). I have successfully colored this to match my own hair color, which is difficult to match. By the way, I bought 2 other Katie colors: #33 &#34;auburn&#34; which is actually a dark brown shade with no red in it whatsoever, & #33/130 which is a dark brown blended with a light copper color.

The bottles are made of thin plastic that look and feel cheap. The trigger action on the sprayers is not smooth or reliable. The sprayer hose detaches easily.<br /><br />Given the price, these are 2 stars for value -- they look, feel and perform as a bottle you'd get in a dollar store.

Great,I have a cosmetology license but I am also frugal. Purchased this to apply my own eyelash extensions and it worked great. I will be purchasing again.<br /><br />I do not recommend applying it to yourself though. It is difficult and you can damage your eyelashes if done incorrectly. The glue also burns your eyeballs.,B07F78RXQT,B07F78RXQT,1.55E+12,2,TRUE,

I like the scissors,I really only wanted this for the cape and the scissors and the scissors are decent.  I've been using them to shape the recent hair cut I gave myself.  They are sharp and have a good weight to them.  I have not used the thinning shears yet so I cannot speak to them.  The other items in the kit are all pretty basic and cheap.  I gave the thin plastic combs to my daughter to use with her dolls.  The cape is thin and the strings in the back for tying seem flimsy.  One of the strings is way to too making tying difficult.  I have not had a need for any of the other items.  I do like the storage case though...a nice compact way to keep everything together and easy to find when it is needed.,B088X2WPTX,B088X2WPTX,1.6E+12,0,FALSE,
"Subtle marbling, pretty color","Since quarantine hit, I've been ordering nails from various stores so that I can still enjoy having my nails done while the shops are closed since I was an every other week nail girl before. These were great for about a week, and I loved how subtle the marble design was. Color was super pretty and matched everything I wore that week nicely. Would definitely recommend these.",B082D8YBCD,B082D8YBCD,1.6E+12,0,TRUE,
"""Sea"" Mist is a Misnomer","*Sigh*<br />This product received rave reviews, so I was very excited to purchase and test it out.<br />My hair is naturally very wavy. If the wave doesn't have product, it isn't tame. So, most mornings I dry/straighten it to avoid looking like a wild banshee at work.<br />However, I recently moved to Florida and because of the humidity, my waves are being a bit more cooperative. That being said, a product like this that would help hold the wave throughout the day and tame the &#34;wildness&#34; is desirable. Unfortunately, this has not worked for me as it is advertised.<br />There isn't enough salt to hold the hair in place. Instead of a subtle stiffness to hold the 'beach wave', my hair appeared a droopy, greasy mess that looks like I'd slept in a frying pan (with leftover bacon grease) rather than the just-off-the-surf look that I was anticipating.<br />Everyone's hair is different, so perhaps this product works better for others. My hair is long and thick. I would think that this may work better for people with shorter hair where gravity isn't fighting with the product all day.<br />Okay, so why did I give this more than one star? IT SMELLS AMAZING! If anything, I'll be using this as a perfume rather than a hair product. Seriously, I can't get enough of the coconutty wonderfulness in the bottle.",B015RR870U,B015RR870U,1.49E+12,4,TRUE,

... this for a couple of months & it works fine. The last one I had worked for years ...,Been using this for a couple of months & it works fine. The last one I had worked for years so I expect nothing less. This is great for people with hand issues. Lifting heavy bottles are no fun.,B01DUYNJL4,B01DUYNJL4,1.53E+12,0,TRUE,
"Big disappointment , waste of money","The product was terrible for the high price I paid. The shampoo made my hair very dry and brittle , in the event I landed up loosing more hair.

Great Products,Every shampoo I use breaks my scalp out.  Discovered this shampoo at CVS.  Am so happy I can get it on Amazon as I am isolating during the Covid outbreak.  Very happy with the shampoo and conditioner.  Great resulst!,B07BR5QSTK,B07BR5QSTK,1.63E+12,0,TRUE,
"Kinda works, but not where I need it.","The product helps to keep my hands a little dry, but not NEARLY as much as I thought it would. They still sweat a lot. I've been using it every night for nearly a week and still no progress. I'll start using talc at night and putting on gloves to help out the product, but I have little hope it'll help.<br /><br />If your hands only get a little sweaty, this product may work for you, but I guess my sweaty hands are too much.",B001O1M6II,B001O1M6II,1.44E+12,3,TRUE,
